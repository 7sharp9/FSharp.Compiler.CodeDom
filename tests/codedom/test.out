We have the following failures in CodeDom tests. If a comment is shown then these are expected (CodeDom support for F# is not fully complete):
 - CallingFieldTest (Static Fields with an InitExpression are Not Initialized Correctly)
 - CallMethodTest (F# doesn't support C# 'new' keyword)
 - CheckSumTest (no #pragma checksum in F# afaik)
 - DeclareField (public static fields not allowed in F#)
 - GenericsTest (F# doesn't permit Dictionary<_,_>() to be called without an equality constraint)
 - IndexersTest (Overriding of abstract indexers not supported by F#)
 - PartialClassTest (partial classes not supported)
 - RegionDirectiveTest (#region isn't supported by F#)
 - TypeTest (public static fields not allowed in F#)
 - VerbatimOrderingTest (order is irelevant - this test is odd)

You can find the log, source, and/or assembly files in the directory:
  C:\GitHub\fsprojects\FSharp.Compiler.CodeDom\tests\codedom\testoutput
Each log, source or assembly file is called <testname>.{log|src|dll}, 
respectively.
